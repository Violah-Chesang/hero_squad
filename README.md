# Hero Squad
CRUD
- An app for a director to recruit Super Heroes to join squads

- There should be a list of super heroes and a list of squads
- The heroes should have xtics e.g age, name, special powers, weakness

-   The squads should have descriptions such as name, max no of a squad, cause they're fighting for, special skills they have etc

- A hero cannot belong to more than one squad at the same time

- the directors should see the available heroes

# How the app operates
- When a user opens the page, they can see a list of all heroes and all squads. 
- They should be able to click on a hero and see more datails about them (xtics) same as the squad
- Be able to see heroes not assigned to a squad
- See squads without a heroes.
- Be able to assign a hero a squad. How? (Have a drop-down menu of unassigned heroes. When you click on one hero, it should take you to another section to display squads without heroes)
